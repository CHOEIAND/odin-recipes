        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Gyūdon (牛丼, "beef bowl"), also known as gyūmeshi (牛飯 or 牛めし, "beef [and] rice"), is a Japanese dish consisting of a bowl of rice 
        topped with beef and onion, simmered in a mildly sweet sauce flavored with dashi (fish and seaweed stock), soy sauce and mirin (sweet rice wine).
        Gyudon (牛丼) is one of the classic comfort foods in Japanese cuisine that’s also become popular overseas (think Yoshinoya). It’s a quick, hearty 
        Japanese beef rice bowl that’s extremely simple to put together—a nutritious and budget-friendly meal that’s always satisfying. While every household 
        in Japan makes gyudon a little differently, I’ll show you my favorite version of this weeknight favorite that I make at home!</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 onion</li>
            <li>1 green onion</li>
            <li>500g thin sliced beef</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dashi</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon sake</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon mirin</li>
            <li>3 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all the ingredients. I usually put the thinly sliced beef in the freezer for 10 minutes because it‘s a lot easier to cut semi-frozen meat.</li>
            <li>First, thinly slice 1/2 onion.</li>
            <li>Next, cut 1 green onion/scallion diagonally into thin slices. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Then, remove 500g thinly sliced beef (chuck or ribeye) from the freezer. Cut the semi-frozen meat into pieces 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide.</li>
            <li>In a large frying pan (do not turn on the heat yet), add ½ cup dashi (Japanese soup stock), 2 Tbsp sake, 2 Tbsp mirin, 3 Tbsp soy sauce, and 1 Tbsp sugar. 
                Stir to combine and dissolve the sugar.</li>
            <li>Next, add the onion slices and spread them in the broth throughout the pan, separating the onion layers.</li>
            <li>Then, distribute the meat on top of the onions. Separate the thin slices of beef so the meat covers the onions.</li>
            <li>Cover the pan with a lid. Now, turn on the heat to medium and start cooking. Once simmering, turn down the heat to simmer and cook, covered, for 3–4 minutes.</li>
            <li>While simmering, open the lid and skim off the scum and fat from the broth with a fine-mesh skimmer one to two times.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the green onions on top and cook covered for another minute. Optional: If you would like to add beaten eggs, you can do it now.</li>
            <li>To serve, divide 2 servings cooked Japanese short-grain rice into large donburi bowls. Then, drizzle some of the pan sauce on top of the rice before adding the beef
                and onion mixture on top.</li>
        </ol>
