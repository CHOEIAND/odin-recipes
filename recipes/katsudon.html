        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>If you’ve never heard of it, Katsudon is basically katsu (a pork chop breaded with panko and fried) over rice with onion and egg. It was awesome, and it became my go-to choice whenever I went to a Japanese place–a fish-less, teriyaki-less haven.
            Since then, I’ve discovered that sushi is, in fact, delicious and amazing, and I now order either sushi or sashimi when we go out for Japanese food.
            But every time, I’ll give a friendly little wave to the Katsudon option on the menu––an old friend. Well, the other day, I decided to make the dish at home, which, as it turns out, is a very simple task. 
            The results of this katsudon recipe were great–the crispy pork, paired with the slightly sweet mixture of egg and onion, all smushed into a pile of rice? What’s not to like?</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 thinly sliced medium onion</li>
            <li>1 green onion (chopped)</li>
            <li>2 centre cut pork chops</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dashi</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon mirin</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
            <li>salt and pepper</li>
            <li>flour for dusting</li>
            <li>3 egg</li>
            <li>1 cup panko crumbs</li>
            <li>oil for frying</li>
            <li>2 servings of steamed white rice</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Season the pounded pork chops with salt and pepper, and dust with a light, even coating of flour. In one shallow bowl, beat the egg. 
                Put the panko into another shallow bowl.</li>
            <li>Add thin, even layer of oil to a cast iron pan or skillet over medium heat. The oil is ready when you throw a panko breadcrumb into the oil and it sizzles. 
                Dip the pork into the egg to coat. Transfer the pork to the panko and press it evenly into the meat to get a good coating.</li>
            <li>Carefully lay the pork chops in the hot oil and cook for 5-6 minutes on one side, until golden brown. Flip and cook the other side for another 5-6 minutes. 
                Drain on a plate lined with a paper towel.</li>
            <li>While the pork is resting, add the stock, sugar, soy sauce, and Mirin to a small bowl. In another bowl, lightly beat 2 eggs. 
                Add a tablespoon of oil to a pan over medium heat, and add the sliced onion. Fry the onions until they’re translucent and slightly caramelized.</li>
            <li>Pour the stock mixture over the onions. Slice your tonkatsu into pieces and place on top of the onions. Drizzle the egg over everything. 
                Cook over medium low heat until the egg is just set. Serve over bowls of steamed rice, and garnish with scallions.</li>
