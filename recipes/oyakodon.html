        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Oyakodon is a classic comfort food of Japanese home cooking. Tender pieces of chicken, onions, and eggs are simmered in 
            an umami-rich sauce and then poured over a bowl of fluffy steamed rice. Simple, delicious, and utterly comforting, this 
            is the kind of one-bowl meal you can cook in less than 30 minutes! During lunchtime, you’d see diners and noodle shops around the office 
            buildings crowded with Japanese office workers making their fuss-free fast food orders. These lunch spots usually serve up quick one-bowl meals, 
            and Oyakodon (親子丼) or Oyako Donburi (親子丼ぶり) is often one of the popular choices.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 onion</li>
            <li>2 chicken thighs</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dashi</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sake</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon mirin</li>
            <li>3 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine ½ cup dashi (Japanese soup stock), 2 Tbsp soy sauce, 2 Tbsp mirin, and 2 tsp sugar in a bowl or a liquid measuring cup and mix all together until the sugar is dissolved.</li>
            <li>Thinly slice 1/2 onion.</li>
            <li>Trim the extra bits of fat and connective tissue from skinless chicken thighs with the knife.</li>
            <li>Cut the chicken thigh along the grain into strips ¾–1 inch (2–2.5 cm) wide. Next, angle your knife back and diagonally 
                (nearly parallel to the cutting board), and then slice the chicken strips against the grain into pieces about ¾–1 inch (2–2.5 cm) square. 
                This sogigiri cutting technique gives the chicken pieces equal thickness and creates more surface area for fast cooking and better absorption of the flavors.</li>
            <li>Transfer the chicken to a bowl or tray and sprinkle with 1 Tbsp sake. Set aside for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Crack 3-4 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell) into a bowl. Using a pair of chopsticks, lift the egg whites to “cut“ them 5–6 times into a few smaller clumps. 
                This will prevent the egg whites from falling into the frying pan all at once. Do not whisk or beat the eggs together. 
                Tip: Aim for high color contrast between the white and yellow parts of the eggs in your finished dish.</li>
            <li>With the stove off, add the sliced onions to a medium frying pan (I use a well-seasoned 11” carbon steel pan) in a single layer. 
                Then, add the seasonings mixture. It should just cover the onions. If not, your frying pan is too big and you need to either increase the seasoning or use a smaller pan.</li>
            <li>Turn on the heat to medium and bring it to a simmer. Once simmering, add the chicken on top of the onions.</li>
            <li>Make sure the onions and chicken are evenly distributed. Once simmering again, lower the heat to medium low. Cook, uncovered, 
                for 5 minutes or until the chicken is no longer pink and the onions are tender. Halfway through, flip the chicken. Tip: Evaporation reduces the sauce and intensifies the flavor.</li>
            <li>We will add the eggs in two stages: Two-thirds of the eggs first, then the remaining one-third later. Now, increase the heat to medium. 
                With the cooking liquid simmering (small bubbles around the edges), drizzle two-thirds of the eggs in a circular pattern over the chicken and onions, 
                avoiding the edges of the pan where the eggs can easily overcook. Tip: Only drizzle the eggs if the cooking liquid is simmering, as with Egg Drop Soup. 
                Also, try to add more egg whites at this stage, as the whites take longer to cook than the yolks. Ideally, we want to keep the yolks soft and runny for the final presentation.</li>
            <li>If the heat is too strong, lower the heat. If the egg is moving toward the edges of the pan, gently gather it toward the center where the heat is not as strong. 
                Optionally, you can cover the pan if the egg whites are taking a long time to set.</li>
            <li>When the eggs are still runny but just set, add the rest of the eggs to the center and around the edges of the pan. 
                Usually, oyakodon in Japan is served while the egg is almost set but still runny (raw eggs are safe to consume in Japan). 
                Tip: For the remaining one-third of the egg, try to distribute more egg yolks so the oyakodon will have a bright yellow color on top. 
                For a good presentation, you can add a beaten extra yolk at the end.</li>
        </ol>
